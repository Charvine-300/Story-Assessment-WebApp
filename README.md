- Implement your changes
- If no conflict, merge to the Development branch
- If conflict arises, they are to be resolved, before being pushed
- Then get QA to test your changes/fixes on the development branch
- Once approved, by QA on test branch, merge original branch to staging
- If no staging, proceed to production

## Deployment

Deployed on Vercel - a seamless deployment and hosting platform that ensures continuous deployment, automatically updating the live site with every code change.
